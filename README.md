# Project-3---Udacity-Front-End-Web-Development-Nanodegree
This project required me to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI for a Weather-Journal App.

## Building
To get the project up and running I followed these steps:

1. Setting up project environment, making sure I have Node and packages installed, and included in my server.js file.
2. Added POST and GET routes to ensure correct retrieval of  data from the server.
3. Acquired API credentials from OpenWeatherMap website.
4. Created async functions to fetch weather data and store it on my local server.
5. Set up a function that updated UI dynamically.

### Languages I used: HTML, CSS, Javascript
